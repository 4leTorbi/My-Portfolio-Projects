# My-Projects
This repository serves as a portfolio of my data analysis and visualization projects. It collects case studies, code samples, and reports developed using Python, SQL, Power BI, and other tools. The goal is to showcase my skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, and storytelling with data.
